# Delegate Delegation 2016 
This is a visualisation that was created for [Major League Data Challenge](http://www.majorleaguedatachallenge.com/), hosted by Graphistry.

## Features:
* Click on states to get further information
* Hover around to see highlighting
* Textures encode what type of voting system is used: `Primary`, `Caucus`, `Convetion`
* Percentage of a texture that fills the state reflects the percentage of the population that is +18, did not look hard enough for data for the territories...
* If there is a maroon ring around the circle, then they are special delegates


## TODO:
* All notes are done inline... awk
* Transpile ES6 code to ES5...

### Bugs:
* Use custom tooltips as if click on circle stack rather than state the tooltip will appear in the wrong area.
